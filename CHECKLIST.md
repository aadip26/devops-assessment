## Quick Test Script

Run this script to test everything quickly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Testing DevOps Assessment..."

# Test 1: Development server
echo "‚úì Testing development server..."
npm install
npm run dev &
DEV_PID=$!
sleep 5
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || echo "‚ùå Dev server failed"
kill $DEV_PID

# Test 2: Docker build
echo "‚úì Testing Docker build..."
docker build -t test-build . || echo "‚ùå Docker build failed"

# Test 3: Docker run
echo "‚úì Testing Docker container..."
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name test-container test-build
sleep 5
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || echo "‚ùå Container health check failed"
docker stop test-container
docker rm test-container

# Test 4: Kubernetes deployment
echo "‚úì Testing Kubernetes deployment..."
minikube start
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=nextjs-app --timeout=300s
kubectl get all

echo "‚úì All tests completed!"
```

Save this as `test.sh`, make it executable (`chmod +x test.sh`), and run it.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ImagePullBackOff | Make GHCR package public |
| Pods not starting | Check image reference in deployment.yaml |
| Health checks failing | Verify `/api/health` endpoint works |
| Can't access service | Use `minikube service` command |
| Build fails | Check Node.js version (need v20+) |
| GitHub Actions fails | Enable workflow permissions in settings |

**Good luck with your submission! üöÄ**
